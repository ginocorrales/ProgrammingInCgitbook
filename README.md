## Why learning C

There are two main differences between Java and C:

* Java is executed mainly by interpretation

  * C \(and its extension C++\) is executed as a compiled \(and optimized\) sequence of instructions  
    Java is highly abstract, with system/hardware details hidden

* Java is highly abstract, with system/hardware details hidden

  * C can interact with the system/hardware much more directly

Hence, C is more suitable as a system implementation language

* OS, device drivers, etc

* Java virtual machine

* Embedded systems \(think of the future innovations of smart devices\)

* Mission critical and high performance applications
